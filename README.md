# Weather API

In this project we display several weather parameters as a function of Latitude. We created visualizations for Maximum Temperature, Humidity, Cloudiness and Wind Speed against Latitude around. We used a Python script combined with the open source OpenWeather Map API to query data for over 600 cities around the world. Then we created plots using Matplotlib to show the relationship between each weather observation and Latitude.
